# Project details

This project is a Laravel 12 application which depends on and uses laravel/ui package's auth scaffolding with Bootstrap for styling and design. But always check this project's `composer.json` and `package.json` for dependencies to make sure that all code you generate follows the proper version of dependencies. 

## Styling

- Always use Bootstrap for styling and building user interfaces.

## Code

- Before generating code, make sure that same functionalities, features are not available from any of the dependencies/libraries/packages installed, If already available then use the same for implementing new features/functionality/writing new code. i.e. don't re-invent the wheel, use dependencies when can use them.
